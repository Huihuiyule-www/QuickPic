        Pick a topic. Look at the picture and answer the questions. Select the correct answer.
        If your answer is correct, the button lights up green, you get a point and the next question appears.
        If your answer is incorrect, the button ligths up red. You loose a live, however, the correct answer will show up, so that you learn for the next round.
        After 5 questions, the next level appears. For each question, you get less time than before, so hurry up.
        If you loose all your lives or don't answer in time, your game is over.
        After 3 levels completed, you get to the highscore list. If your score is within the best 3, you may enter your name.
